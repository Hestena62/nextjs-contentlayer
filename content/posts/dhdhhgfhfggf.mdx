Abstract
This paper provides a comprehensive review of phonological awareness, with a specific focus on rhyming ability, and its critical relationship to developmental dyslexia. Phonological awareness, the conscious ability to manipulate the sound structure of spoken language, is a foundational skill for literacy acquisition. Rhyming, an early component of onset-rime awareness, serves as a significant predictor of later reading success. A core tenet of dyslexia research, the Phonological Deficit Hypothesis, posits that individuals with dyslexia experience a primary impairment in phonological processing, consistently manifesting as persistent difficulties with rhyming and, more profoundly, with phonemic awareness. This review details the multifaceted impact of these deficits on decoding, encoding, and ultimately, reading comprehension. It further outlines key formal and informal assessment methods for identifying phonological awareness weaknesses and presents evidence-based intervention strategies, emphasizing explicit, systematic, and multisensory approaches. The paper concludes by highlighting the imperative for early identification, targeted intervention, and collaborative support to mitigate the adverse effects of phonological deficits on students with dyslexia, thereby fostering their literacy development.

1. Introduction
Developmental dyslexia, a specific learning disability of neurobiological origin, poses significant challenges for millions of individuals worldwide (International Dyslexia Association [IDA], n.d.). Characterized primarily by difficulties in accurate and fluent word recognition, poor spelling, and decoding abilities, dyslexia's impact extends far beyond the classroom, affecting academic achievement, self-esteem, and future opportunities (Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 2005). While various factors can contribute to reading difficulties, the scientific consensus firmly points to a core deficit in phonological processing as the primary underlying cause of dyslexia (Snowling, 2000; Vellutino, 1979).

Central to this phonological deficit is impaired phonological awareness (PA) , the meta-cognitive ability to consciously recognize and manipulate the sound structure of spoken language (Anthony & Lonigan, 2004). Within the hierarchy of phonological skills, rhyming holds a particularly significant position. As an early-developing component of onset-rime awareness, rhyming ability serves as both a critical building block for more complex phonological skills and a robust early predictor of later reading success (Ehri et al., 2001). For students with dyslexia, persistent struggles with rhyming are often one of the earliest and most observable indicators of their phonological vulnerability (Catts et al., 2005).

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed exploration of phonological awareness, with a specific emphasis on the role of rhyming, and its profound impact on students with dyslexia. It will delve into the theoretical underpinnings of the phonological deficit hypothesis, examine the specific manifestations of phonological weaknesses in dyslexic learners, discuss the far-reaching consequences for reading comprehension, and outline evidence-based assessment and intervention strategies. By synthesizing current research, this review seeks to underscore the critical importance of early identification and targeted phonological instruction, particularly focusing on rhyming, as essential components of effective support for students with dyslexia.

2.0 Understanding Phonological Awareness
Phonological awareness is a foundational linguistic skill that refers to an individual's conscious awareness of the sound structure of a language, independent of its meaning (Ehri, 2004). It is a purely auditory skill, meaning it does not involve print. This distinction is crucial, as PA is a prerequisite for, rather than a consequence of, learning to read an alphabetic language where letters represent sounds (NICHD, 2000). PA encompasses a range of abilities, typically developing along a continuum from larger, more easily perceivable units of sound to smaller, more discrete units.

The generally accepted hierarchy of phonological awareness skills includes:

2.1 Word Awareness: The most rudimentary level of PA involves the understanding that spoken sentences are comprised of individual, discrete words. For instance, a child demonstrating word awareness can identify the number of words in a simple sentence such as "The dog barked loudly" by clapping or tapping for each word (Reading Rockets, n.d.). This foundational understanding helps children begin to segment continuous speech into meaningful units.
2.2 Syllable Awareness: Progressing from word awareness, syllable awareness refers to the ability to hear and manipulate the syllables within words. Syllables are rhythmic units of pronunciation that contain a vowel sound. Key skills at this level include:
Syllable Blending: Combining individual syllables to form a complete word (e.g., blending "rab-bit" to form "rabbit").
Syllable Segmentation: Breaking a multi-syllabic word into its constituent syllables (e.g., segmenting "elephant" into "el-e-phant") (Reading Rockets, n.d.). This skill aids in early decoding by simplifying longer words into manageable chunks.
2.3 Onset-Rime Awareness: This level involves the ability to dissect a single-syllable word into two parts: the onset and the rime. The onset is defined as the initial consonant sound or consonant blend that precedes the vowel in a syllable (e.g., /c/ in "cat," /str/ in "street"). The rime encompasses the vowel sound and all subsequent consonant sounds within that same syllable (e.g., /at/ in "cat," /eet/ in "street") (Reading Rockets, n.d.). This specific skill is particularly salient for understanding rhyming patterns and word families.
2.4 Phonemic Awareness (PAw): As the most advanced and highly predictive level of phonological awareness for reading success, phonemic awareness is the conscious ability to identify, isolate, segment, blend, and manipulate individual speech sounds, or phonemes, within words (NICHD, 2000). English has approximately 44 distinct phonemes. Mastering phonemic awareness is critical because it directly underlies the alphabetic principle, the understanding that letters and letter combinations represent specific phonemes. Key phonemic awareness skills include:
Phoneme Isolation: Identifying specific phonemes in a given position within a word (e.g., "What is the middle sound in 'mop'?" - /o/) (Heggerty, n.d.).
Phoneme Blending: Combining a sequence of isolated phonemes to form a complete word (e.g., blending /d/ /o/ /g/ to pronounce "dog") (IDA, n.d.). This skill is directly applied during decoding when sounding out new words.
Phoneme Segmentation: Breaking down a spoken word into its individual constituent phonemes (e.g., segmenting "fish" into /f/ /i/ /sh/) (IDA, n.d.). This is the inverse of blending and is fundamental for accurate spelling (encoding).
Phoneme Manipulation: The most cognitively demanding phonemic awareness tasks, involving the addition, deletion, or substitution of phonemes within words (e.g., "Say 'snail' without the /s/." - "nail"; "Change the /m/ in 'man' to /f/." - "fan") (Reading Rockets, n.d.). These tasks demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of a word's internal sound structure.
The development of these skills is sequential, with mastery of simpler skills often facilitating the acquisition of more complex ones. Disruptions at any level of this hierarchy can have cascading negative effects on literacy development.

3.0 The Pivotal Role of Rhyming in Phonological Awareness
3.1 Fostering Auditory Sensitivity and Discrimination: Engaging in rhyming activities naturally draws a child’s attention to the auditory patterns and shared sound structures within spoken words (Goswami, 2000). To identify or produce a rhyme, a child must actively listen for and discriminate between subtle phonetic similarities and differences. This process refines their auditory processing skills, enabling them to perceive that words are not monolithic units but are composed of separable sound components. This enhanced auditory acuity forms a crucial foundation for later, more precise phonemic discriminations.
3.2 Bridging to the Alphabetic Principle: Rhyming serves as a critical bridge to understanding the alphabetic principle, the fundamental concept that printed letters and letter combinations represent specific speech sounds (Snowling, 1995; Wimmer et al., 1991). By repeatedly encountering words that share a common rime (e.g., the /ug/ sound in “bug,” “rug,” “mug”), children begin to unconsciously grasp the consistent relationship between sounds and the letters that represent those sounds. This early exposure to recurring sound patterns helps to demystify the seemingly arbitrary nature of written language. When children recognize that “cat” and “hat” share the same ending sound, they are poised to understand that the initial sound is what differentiates them, leading naturally into the concept of distinct phonemes.
3.3 Early Predictor of Reading Success: Perhaps the most compelling reason for the emphasis on rhyming is its robust predictive validity for future reading and spelling achievement. Numerous longitudinal studies have consistently demonstrated that a child’s early ability to recognize and produce rhymes is a strong and reliable indicator of their readiness for reading and their likelihood of success in acquiring literacy skills (Anthony & Lonigan, 2004; Bowey, 2005; Ehri et al., 2001). Conversely, a persistent difficulty with rhyming in preschool or kindergarten is one of the earliest and most significant “red flags” for identifying children at risk for later reading difficulties, including developmental dyslexia (Catts et al., 2005; Reading Rockets, n.d.; Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.b). This predictive power makes rhyming a crucial skill to assess and foster in early childhood education.
In essence, rhyming is not merely a playful language activity but a foundational cognitive exercise that attunes the child’s ear to the internal sound structure of words, preparing their minds for the systematic decoding and encoding processes inherent in reading and writing an alphabetic script.

4.0 Dyslexia: The Phonological Deficit Hypothesis and Rhyming Difficulties
Developmental dyslexia is a specific learning disability that affects an individual's ability to read, spell, and write, despite having average or above-average intelligence, adequate educational opportunities, and intact sensory abilities (IDA, n.d.). The most widely accepted and empirically supported theoretical explanation for dyslexia is the Phonological Deficit Hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that the primary underlying cause of dyslexia is an inherent impairment in the phonological component of language. This deficit manifests as difficulties in perceiving, storing, retrieving, and manipulating the basic speech sounds (phonemes) of one's language (Snowling, 2000; Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 2005; Ramus, 2003; Vellutino, 1979).

4.1 Core Characteristics of Phonological Deficits in Dyslexia:
Persistent Rhyming Challenges: As highlighted previously, one of the earliest and most consistent clinical indicators of dyslexia risk is a notable and persistent difficulty with rhyming. While typically developing children begin to enjoy and master rhyming around ages three to four, children who later develop dyslexia often struggle significantly with tasks requiring rhyme recognition, production, or completion (Catts et al., 2005; Reading Rockets, n.d.; Dyslexia UK, n.d.). This difficulty is not merely a delay but often a qualitative difference in their ability to process and generalize sound patterns.
Profound Impairment in Phonemic Awareness: The most significant and consistently documented phonological deficit in dyslexia is impaired phonemic awareness (IDA, n.d.). Students with dyslexia typically struggle with all facets of phonemic awareness, including:
Phoneme Blending: The inability to smoothly combine individual sounds to form a complete word. This directly impacts their ability to "sound out" words during reading (IDA, n.d.). For example, given the sounds /b/, /æ/, /t/, a student with dyslexia might struggle to synthesize them into "bat."
Phoneme Segmentation: Significant difficulty breaking down spoken words into their discrete sound units. This directly impedes spelling (encoding), as they cannot accurately represent each sound with its corresponding letter(s) (Dyslexia UK, n.d.). A student might hear "dog" but write "dg" due to an inability to segment all three phonemes.
Phoneme Manipulation: These advanced tasks, such as deleting a sound from a word (e.g., saying "light" without the /l/), adding a sound, or substituting one sound for another (e.g., changing the /o/ in "top" to /i/ to make "tip"), are particularly challenging and often indicative of a deep-seated phonological processing weakness (Bradley & Bryant, 1978; Catts et al., 2005).
Naming Speed Deficits (Rapid Automatized Naming - RAN): While distinct from PA, many individuals with dyslexia also exhibit deficits in rapid automatized naming (RAN), which involves quickly naming a series of familiar items (e.g., letters, numbers, colors, objects). This is thought to reflect a broader deficit in accessing and retrieving phonological information from long-term memory (Wolf & Bowers, 1999).
4.2 Neurological Underpinnings: The phonological deficit in dyslexia is not merely behavioral; it has a clear neurobiological basis. Functional neuroimaging studies (e.g., fMRI) consistently reveal atypical brain activation patterns in individuals with dyslexia, particularly in the left hemisphere's posterior reading system. During phonological tasks, individuals with dyslexia often show reduced activation in key brain regions associated with language processing and reading, including:
Left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), involved in speech production and some aspects of phonological processing.
Left parietotemporal region , crucial for phonological processing and word analysis.
The left occipitotemporal region (often referred to as the "visual word form area" or VWFA), which is typically specialized for rapid, automatic word recognition (Gabrieli et al., 2011; Ramus, 2003; CPD Online College, n.d.). These differences in neural activation are observed even during tasks that involve only auditory processing of speech sounds, without any visual print, reinforcing the notion of a fundamental phonological processing difference. Some studies also indicate compensatory over-activation in homologous right-hemisphere regions in individuals with dyslexia (CPD Online College, n.d.). These neurological findings provide strong empirical support for the phonological deficit hypothesis as the primary explanation for dyslexia.
The consistent presence of rhyming difficulties as an early marker, coupled with profound phonemic awareness deficits and distinct neurobiological profiles, firmly establishes the central role of phonological processing weaknesses in the etiology of developmental dyslexia.

5.0 Impact on Reading Comprehension
While the direct effects of phonological awareness deficits in dyslexia are most evident at the word level (decoding and spelling), these foundational challenges have significant and cascading negative consequences for overall reading comprehension. Reading comprehension is not merely about recognizing individual words; it requires efficient, automatic word recognition to free up cognitive resources for higher-level processes like inferencing, vocabulary integration, and text structure understanding (National Reading Panel, 2000).

5.1 Cognitive Load and Working Memory Overload: For students with dyslexia, every encounter with an unfamiliar word can become a laborious decoding exercise. This slow, effortful, and often inaccurate word recognition places an immense cognitive load on the reader. Precious working memory resources, which are essential for holding and manipulating information to construct meaning, are predominantly consumed by the basic act of decoding. As a result, fewer cognitive resources remain available for understanding the meaning of individual sentences, let alone synthesizing information across paragraphs or making inferences (Lexia Learning, 2024; Snowling, 1995). The student may read word-by-word, losing the overarching narrative or informational flow.
5.2 Reduced Reading Fluency: The struggle with decoding directly leads to poor reading fluency, characterized by slow reading rate, numerous errors, and a lack of appropriate prosody (expression and rhythm). Fluent reading allows for automatic word recognition, which enables the reader to focus on meaning rather than individual word identification. When fluency is impaired, comprehension suffers because the reader cannot process the text quickly or smoothly enough to build a coherent mental model of the content (Lexia Learning, 2024).
5.3 Limited Exposure to Print and Vocabulary Development: A challenging and often frustrating reading experience frequently leads students with dyslexia to avoid reading. This reduced exposure to print, often termed the "Matthew Effect" (Stanovich, 1986), means they miss out on the rich opportunities for incidental vocabulary acquisition, exposure to diverse sentence structures, and the accumulation of general background knowledge that typically developing readers gain through extensive reading. This lack of exposure further hinders their comprehension, particularly as texts become more complex and domain-specific (Lexia Learning, 2024). A smaller vocabulary directly impacts comprehension as unknown words impede understanding.
5.4 Disconnection Between Oral Language and Reading Comprehension: It is crucial to note that many individuals with dyslexia possess intact or even superior oral language comprehension abilities (Gough & Tunmer, 1886). They may understand complex spoken narratives or instructions perfectly well. However, their phonological decoding difficulties create a "bottleneck" that prevents them from accessing their strong oral language skills when confronted with written text. This disconnect is a defining feature of dyslexia, where the primary barrier to comprehension lies in the translation of print to meaning, stemming from the phonological deficit, rather than a general language comprehension deficit (Lexia Learning, 2024).
In summary, while the phonological deficit initially manifests at the word level, its ripple effects permeate all aspects of literacy. By hindering efficient word recognition, it ultimately starves the higher-level comprehension processes, making reading a significantly more arduous and less meaningful experience for individuals with dyslexia.

6.0 Assessment of Phonological Awareness
Early and accurate assessment of phonological awareness is critical for identifying children at risk for dyslexia, informing diagnostic decisions, and guiding the development of effective, individualized interventions. Assessments should be conducted systematically and often involve both formal, standardized measures and informal, criterion-referenced tasks.

6.1 Principles of Assessment:
Auditory Focus: Initial assessments of phonological awareness, especially in young children, should primarily focus on oral-auditory tasks, without the presence of print. This ensures that the assessment truly measures the child's ability to manipulate sounds, not their knowledge of letters (Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.a; Heggerty, n.d.).
Developmental Progression: Assessments should cover a range of PA skills, progressing from simpler to more complex tasks, reflecting the typical developmental hierarchy (e.g., word awareness, syllable awareness, onset-rime awareness, and then various levels of phonemic awareness).
Observation of Process: Beyond just correct/incorrect responses, clinicians and educators should observe the child's processing time, effort, and strategies used. A child who eventually gets the right answer but struggles significantly may still indicate an underlying deficit.
6.2 Formal Assessments:
Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, Second Edition (CTOPP-2): The CTOPP-2 is one of the most widely used and highly regarded diagnostic tools for assessing phonological abilities in individuals from ages 4-0 through 24-11. It comprises multiple subtests that measure various aspects of phonological awareness (e.g., blending nonwords, segmenting nonwords, elision), phonological memory (e.g., memory for digits, nonword repetition), and rapid naming (Robertson & Salter, 2007; Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.a). Performance across these subtests provides a comprehensive profile of an individual's phonological strengths and weaknesses.
Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS 8th Edition): While broader literacy screeners, DIBELS measures include brief, curriculum-based measures that tap into early phonological awareness skills, such as First Sound Fluency (FSF) and Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF), making them useful for universal screening and progress monitoring in educational settings.
6.3 Informal Assessments (Focus on Rhyming and Early Skills):
Rhyme Recognition: Present two words and ask, "Do 'cat' and 'hat' rhyme?" (Yes/No response).
Rhyme Production/Generation: Ask the child to generate words that rhyme with a given word (e.g., "Tell me words that rhyme with 'blue'."). This is a more challenging task than recognition and often indicates a deeper understanding (Reading Rockets, n.d.).
Rhyme Completion: Provide a sentence with a missing rhyming word (e.g., "The frog sat on a... [log]").
Odd-One-Out: Present three words and ask which one doesn't rhyme (e.g., "Which word doesn't rhyme: 'bear', 'chair', 'moon'?") (Reading Rockets, n.d.).
Nursery Rhyme Knowledge/Recitation: Assess a child's familiarity with and ability to recite common nursery rhymes. Lack of exposure or difficulty with these often signals a lack of sensitivity to rhyming patterns (Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.b).
Picture Sorts: Provide a collection of pictures and ask the child to group those that rhyme.
Consistent struggles across these informal rhyming tasks, particularly after age four or five, should trigger further formal assessment for potential phonological awareness deficits and risk for dyslexia.

7.0 Intervention Strategies for Phonological Awareness
Effective intervention for phonological awareness deficits in students with dyslexia is paramount for fostering literacy development. Research consistently supports the efficacy of explicit, systematic, and multisensory instructional approaches, ideally initiated as early as possible (NICHD, 2000; Reading Teacher, n.d.). Early intervention, particularly in preschool and kindergarten, yields the most profound and lasting benefits, as it targets skills before reading failure becomes entrenched.

7.1 General Principles of Effective PA Intervention:
Explicit and Direct Instruction: Phonological awareness skills must be taught directly and intentionally. Instructions should be clear, concise, and modeled by the instructor (IDA, n.d.).
Systematic and Sequential Progression: Instruction should follow a logical, research-based sequence, moving from simpler, larger units of sound to more complex, smaller units. This typically means beginning with word and syllable awareness, progressing to onset-rime (including rhyming), and then to the various levels of phonemic awareness (Heggerty, n.d.; Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.a).
Oral-Auditory Focus (Initially): In the early stages, instruction should be primarily auditory and oral. Avoid introducing letters or print until a solid understanding of sound manipulation is established (Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.a; Heggerty, n.d.).
Multisensory Engagement: Use multisensory approaches that engage auditory, visual, kinesthetic, and tactile pathways. This can include hand movements, tapping out syllables, using blocks or chips for phonemes, or tracing letters in sand (Reading Teacher, n.d.; Dyslexia Help at the University of Michigan, n.d.a).
High Repetition and Practice: Students with dyslexia require more practice and repetition to achieve mastery and automaticity of phonological skills (IDA, n.d.). Activities should be engaging and provide ample opportunities for repeated exposure.
Bridge to Phonics: Once a foundation in phonological awareness is established, make explicit connections to phonics instruction, teaching the relationship between phonemes (sounds) and graphemes (letters) (Reading Teacher, n.d.; Heggerty, n.d.).
7.2 Specific Strategies for Rhyming Intervention:
Given its foundational importance, specific strategies for teaching rhyming are crucial:

Read Aloud Rhyming Literature: Read books, poems, and nursery rhymes with strong rhyming patterns. Exaggerate rhyming words and pause to ask children to identify or predict them (Reading Rockets, n.d.).
Sing Rhyming Songs and Chants: Use songs and chants that emphasize rhyming words. Encourage children to sing along and identify rhymes (Reading Teacher, n.d.).
Interactive Rhyming Games:
Rhyme Matching/Sorting: Provide a target word and ask the child to find another word or picture that rhymes. Use picture cards for non-readers.
Rhyme Production: Ask, "What rhymes with 'tree'?" and encourage brainstorming of multiple rhyming words.
"I'm Thinking Of" Game: "I'm thinking of a word that rhymes with 'ball' and you can play with it." (doll).
Silly Rhyme Stories/Poems: Encourage children to create their own silly rhyming sentences or poems.
Movement-Based Rhyming: Clap for each rhyming word, or use a hand gesture when a rhyming pair is identified.
7.3 Progression to Advanced Phonemic Awareness Skills:
After rhyming and syllable awareness are established, intervention should systematically move towards phoneme-level tasks:

Phoneme Isolation: Start with initial sounds ("What's the first sound in 'sun'?"), then final sounds, and finally medial vowel sounds.
Phoneme Blending with Manipulatives: Use "sound boxes" or "Elkonin boxes" with chips. Say /s/ /u/ /n/, have the child push a chip for each sound, then blend to say "sun."
Phoneme Segmentation: Say "cat," and have the child push a chip for each sound: /c/ (chip) /a/ (chip) /t/ (chip). This supports spelling.
Phoneme Manipulation: Gradually introduce more challenging tasks:
Deletion: "Say 'smile' without the /s/."
Addition: "Add /s/ to the beginning of 'top'."
Substitution: "Change the /a/ in 'bat' to /u/'." These advanced skills are strongly correlated with reading and spelling success.
Effective phonological awareness intervention is a cornerstone of literacy instruction for students with dyslexia. It empowers them by building the fundamental sound-processing skills necessary to unlock the alphabetic code.

8.0 Collaboration and Ongoing Support
Addressing the needs of students with dyslexia requires a multifaceted and collaborative approach involving various professionals and consistent, long-term support. The impact of phonological awareness deficits extends throughout the educational journey, necessitating vigilance and tailored interventions beyond the early elementary years.

8.1 Role of Professionals:
Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs): SLPs possess expertise in the sound system of language and play a crucial role in the early identification, assessment, and intervention for phonological awareness difficulties, particularly in the pre-literacy and emergent literacy stages. They can provide highly individualized, intensive therapy that targets specific phonological weaknesses and bridges oral language to written language (ASHA, n.d.; GSA, n.d.).
Educators (Classroom Teachers, Reading Specialists, Special Education Teachers): All educators working with students at risk for or diagnosed with dyslexia must have comprehensive training in evidence-based literacy instruction, particularly Structured Literacy approaches. These approaches, often based on Orton-Gillingham principles, are explicit, systematic, diagnostic, and multisensory, integrating phonological awareness with phonics, morphology, syntax, and semantics (IDA, n.d.; Lexia Learning, 2024). Reading specialists and special education teachers often provide more intensive, small-group, or one-on-one interventions.
Psychologists/Neuropsychologists: These professionals are crucial for comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, determining the specific learning disability (dyslexia), assessing cognitive profiles (e.g., IQ, working memory, processing speed), and ruling out other contributing factors.
8.2 Importance of Parental Involvement: Parents are invaluable partners in supporting a child's phonological development. Engaging in rhyming games, singing rhyming songs, reading rhyming books, and simply talking about words and sounds at home provides crucial early exposure and practice. Parents can reinforce skills learned at school and create a language-rich environment that nurtures emergent literacy (Reading Rockets, n.d.).
8.3 Longitudinal Vigilance and Support: Phonological deficits associated with dyslexia are typically persistent, meaning they do not simply disappear with age. While intensive early intervention can significantly mitigate their impact, individuals with dyslexia may continue to require support with phonological processing as they encounter more complex words (e.g., multisyllabic words), more challenging reading materials, and advanced spelling demands (de Jong & van der Leij, 2003; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2012). Therefore, ongoing monitoring, accommodations (e.g., extended time, audiobooks), and continued direct instruction in advanced phonological awareness and related decoding strategies may be necessary throughout their academic careers. The goal is not to "cure" dyslexia but to equip individuals with effective strategies and a strong foundation to become proficient readers and spellers, enabling them to access the curriculum and pursue their educational and career goals.
Collaboration among professionals, consistent application of evidence-based practices, and sustained support across educational stages are vital to empowering students with dyslexia to overcome their phonological challenges and achieve literacy success.

9.0 Conclusion
The intricate relationship between phonological awareness, specifically rhyming, and developmental dyslexia is a well-established and critically important area in literacy research and practice. This paper has underscored that phonological awareness, the conscious ability to manipulate the sound structure of spoken language, serves as a foundational skill for acquiring reading and spelling proficiency in alphabetic languages. Rhyming, as an early and accessible component of onset-rime awareness, plays a pivotal role in developing a child's auditory sensitivity to the internal structure of words and stands as a robust early predictor of future literacy success.

For individuals with dyslexia, a neurobiological learning disability, a primary deficit in phonological processing is the widely accepted explanatory model. This deficit consistently manifests as significant and persistent difficulties with rhyming and, more profoundly, with various phonemic awareness tasks. These core phonological weaknesses directly impede the acquisition of decoding and encoding skills, subsequently placing a substantial cognitive burden on working memory and thereby hindering reading fluency and ultimately, reading comprehension.

Effective intervention is not only possible but imperative. Research strongly advocates for explicit, systematic, and multisensory instruction in phonological awareness, initiated as early as possible. Such interventions must systematically progress through the hierarchy of phonological skills, from basic rhyming to advanced phoneme manipulation, while seamlessly bridging to phonics instruction. Furthermore, a collaborative approach involving speech-language pathologists, educators, and parents, coupled with longitudinal vigilance and support, is essential to provide students with dyslexia the necessary tools and strategies to navigate their learning journey successfully.

By understanding the profound impact of phonological awareness, particularly rhyming, on students with dyslexia, educators and clinicians can implement targeted assessments and evidence-based interventions that empower these learners to unlock the complexities of written language, overcome their challenges, and achieve their full academic and personal potential. Investing in early and sustained phonological awareness instruction is not merely a pedagogical choice; it is a critical step towards ensuring literacy for all.
